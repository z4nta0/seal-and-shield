 * vite.config.ts = Vite Config

 * @summary
 * The build and dev server config. It compiles React, reads CSS module class
 * names as camelCase keys, and, for production builds only, compacts
 * index.html, which Vite processes but never minifies, so the page's comments,
 * indentation, and JSON-LD whitespace stay out of what visitors download.
 * Every other setting stays at Vite's default, including copying the files in
 * public/ (icons, the social card, crawler files, and Netlify's _headers and
 * _redirects) into the build untouched.

/**
 * minHtmFun = Minify HTML Function
 *
 * @summary
 * Builds the Vite plugin that compacts the shipped index.html. Vite injects
 * the bundle's script and stylesheet tags into the page but otherwise ships
 * it as written, with every comment and indentation level the formatting
 * rules give it. For production builds only, this re-serializes the
 * page's JSON-LD on one line, which also fails the build if that JSON is
 * ever invalid, strips the page's HTML comments and the comment inside its
 * external script tag, trims every line, and drops blank lines. The
 * newlines between lines are kept, so text wrapped across lines keeps the
 * space between its words. It runs after Vite's own transforms, so the tags
 * Vite injects are compacted too. The dev server serves the page as written.
 *
 * @author z4nta0 <https://github.com/z4nta0>
 *
 * @param void - This function takes no parameters.
 *
 * @returns The plugin object, for the config's plugins array.

 * ```ts
 * minHtmFun() // => { apply, name, transformIndexHtml }
 * ```

	name  : 'minify-shipped-page', // What: Name. Why: Vite reports a plugin's warnings and errors under its name. How: This names the plugin.

	transformIndexHtml : { // What: Transform Index HTML Hook. Why: Vite processes index.html but doesn't minify it. How: This compacts the page after Vite's own changes.

Why: Structured data reads the same without its indentation, and invalid JSON should stop the build rather than ship. How: This parses each JSON-LD script's contents and writes them back on one line.
				.replace( /(<script\b[^>]*\bsrc=[^>]*>)\s*(?:\/\*[\s\S]*?\*\/\s*)+(<\/script>)/g, '$1$2' ) // What: External Script Comment Strip. Why: An external script's only content is its comment. How: This empties the tag.
