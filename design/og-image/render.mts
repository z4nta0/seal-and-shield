import { chromium      } from '@playwright/test'; // What: Chromium. Why: The card is captured in a real browser so it uses the site's own fonts and tokens. How: This launches Playwright's Chromium.
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';         // What: File URL To Path. Why: The output path is resolved from this script's own location. How: This turns a file URL into a path.
import { statSync      } from 'node:fs';          // What: Stat Sync. Why: The finished image has to stay under the size WhatsApp accepts. How: This reads its size in bytes.

/**
 * render.mts = Social Preview Card Renderer
 *
 * @summary
 * Rebuilds public/og-image.png, the 1,200x630 card shown when a link to the
 * site is shared, from card.html beside this script. It opens the card in
 * Chromium at exactly 1,200x630, waits for the site's fonts and the logo,
 * captures it as a PNG, and fails if the file reaches 300 KB, the most
 * WhatsApp will show. Run it with npm run og-image whenever the card or the
 * site's look changes, and give a changed image a new filename, since apps
 * cache previews.
 *
 * Sections:
 *  - Constants
 *  - Module Init

const OUT_PAT_STR = fileURLToPath( new URL( '../../public/og-image.png', import.meta.url ) ); // What: Output Path String. Why: The tags point at the card in public/. How: This resolves that path from this script's folder.
