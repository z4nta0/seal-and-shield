import react      from 'eslint-plugin-react';       // What: React. Why: An undefined component in a JSX tag should fail lint. How: This registers the plugin behind react/jsx-no-undef.
import reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks'; // What: React Hooks. Why: Hook calls follow rules plain JS linting can't check. How: Its recommended rules are spread into the .tsx config.
import tseslint   from 'typescript-eslint';         // What: TypeScript ESLint. Why: ESLint's default parser can't read TypeScript's type annotations. How: Its recommended rules are spread into the config, and its parser is set on both configs below.

/**
 * eslint.config.ts = ESLint Config
 *
 * @summary
 * The lint config, reading every file through typescript-eslint's parser so
 * type annotations parse, with typescript-eslint's recommended rules on for
 * every file, letting a binding beside a rest element go unread and a
 * destructuring that reassigns some of its bindings stay let. Every .ts and
 * .tsx file under src/ is checked by react/jsx-no-undef, which catches a
 * component reference a rename missed. ESLint's own no-undef is left off, as
 * typescript-eslint recommends, since TypeScript already reports every
 * undefined name and no-undef can't see TypeScript's type-only names. Every
 * .tsx file also gets the React Hooks plugin's recommended rules, minus the
 * four React Compiler readiness rules, which only matter to a site built with
 * the React Compiler, which this one isn't. Generated output (dist/ and
 * tests/output/) is ignored. npm run lint runs it across the repo, and an
 * editor integration can run it per file. Adapted from ease-my-life's own
 * config.

// #region Constants

const ESL_CON_ARR = [ // What: ESLint Config Array. Why: ESLint reads its flat config as an array of objects, each scoped to the files it lists. How: This holds the build-output ignore, typescript-eslint's recommended configs and two rule overrides, the src/ undefined-component config, and the .tsx hooks config.


	{ ignores : [ 'dist/**', 'tests/output/**' ] }, // What: Ignores Object. Why: The build output and the test suites' reports are generated, not hand-written, so their lint results mean nothing. How: This global ignores entry skips both folders for every config below; one glob each, since braces break ESLint's matching here.

	...tseslint.configs.recommended, // What: Recommended Configs Spread. Why: typescript-eslint's recommended rules catch TypeScript mistakes the compiler allows, such as an any or an unused variable. How: This spreads its recommended configs in, which apply to every file ESLint lints and switch off the core rules TypeScript already covers.

	{ // What: Rule Overrides Object. Why: Two recommended rules flag patterns the formatting rules rely on. How: This re-sets both rules with an option that allows those patterns.


		rules : { // What: Rules. Why: Each override keeps its rule on, just with one option changed. How: This holds both overrides.


			'@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars' : [ 'error', { ignoreRestSiblings : true } ], // What: Unused Vars Rule. Why: Dropping a field from a copy by destructuring it away beside a rest element leaves that binding unread on purpose. How: This lets a binding next to a rest element go unread.
			'prefer-const'                      : [ 'error', { destructuring : 'all' } ]      // What: Prefer Const Rule. Why: A destructuring that reassigns some of its bindings has to use let for all of them, since one declaration can't mix const and let. How: This only asks for const when every binding in the destructuring could be one.


		}


	},

	{ // What: Source Config Object. Why: A component reference a rename missed should fail lint everywhere under src/. How: This turns on react/jsx-no-undef for every .ts and .tsx file there.


		files   : [ 'src/**/*.ts', 'src/**/*.tsx' ],  // What: Files. Why: Only the site's own source is linted by these rules. How: This lists one glob per extension.
		plugins : { react },                          // What: Plugins. Why: react/jsx-no-undef comes from the React plugin. How: This registers it.
		rules   : { 'react/jsx-no-undef' : 'error' }, // What: Rules. Why: An undefined component in a JSX tag is always a bug, and TypeScript reports every other undefined name. How: This makes the JSX rule an error.

		languageOptions : { // What: Language Options. Why: The parser has to know the syntax the source uses. How: This sets the TypeScript parser and modern module syntax with JSX.


			ecmaVersion   : 'latest',                          // What: Ecma Version. Why: The source uses current JavaScript syntax. How: This parses the latest version.
			parser        : tseslint.parser,                   // What: Parser. Why: The source is TypeScript, which ESLint's default parser can't read. How: This sets typescript-eslint's parser.
			parserOptions : { ecmaFeatures : { jsx : true } }, // What: Parser Options. Why: The .tsx files contain JSX. How: This turns on JSX parsing.
			sourceType    : 'module'                           // What: Source Type. Why: Every source file is an ES module. How: This parses import and export.

	},

	{ // What: JSX Config Object. Why: Hook calls in components follow rules of their own. How: This adds the React Hooks recommended rules for every .tsx file.


		files   : [ '**/*.tsx' ],                        // What: Files. Why: Hooks only appear in .tsx files. How: This matches every one of them.
		plugins : { react, 'react-hooks' : reactHooks }, // What: Plugins. Why: The hooks rules come from the React Hooks plugin. How: This registers it beside the React plugin.

		languageOptions : { // What: Language Options. Why: These files are TypeScript with JSX. How: This sets the TypeScript parser and turns on JSX parsing.


			parser        : tseslint.parser,                   // What: Parser. Why: ESLint's default parser can't read TypeScript. How: This sets typescript-eslint's parser.
			parserOptions : { ecmaFeatures : { jsx : true } }, // What: Parser Options. Why: These files contain JSX. How: This turns on JSX parsing.


		},

		rules : { // What: Rules. Why: The plugin's recommended set is the standard hooks checks, but four of its rules only judge whether a component suits the React Compiler, which this site doesn't use. How: This spreads the recommended set in, then turns those four off.


			...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules, // What: Recommended Rules Spread. Why: These are the standard hooks checks, rules-of-hooks and exhaustive-deps among them. How: This spreads the plugin's recommended set in first, so the overrides below win.

			'react-hooks/preserve-manual-memoization' : 'off', // What: Preserve Manual Memoization Rule. Why: It only reports where the compiler would skip a component. How: This turns it off.
			'react-hooks/purity'                      : 'off', // What: Purity Rule. Why: It flags impure calls the compiler can't place, including ones that only run in event handlers. How: This turns it off.
			'react-hooks/refs'                        : 'off', // What: Refs Rule. Why: Reading a ref during render only conflicts with the compiler, not with React itself. How: This turns it off.
			'react-hooks/set-state-in-effect'         : 'off'  // What: Set State In Effect Rule. Why: Syncing or measuring into state inside an effect is a working React pattern that only costs an extra render outside the compiler. How: This turns it off.
