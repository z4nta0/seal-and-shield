import { expect      } from '@playwright/test';     // What: Expect. Why: A state passes only with no violations. How: This asserts the violation list is empty.
import { opeStaFun   } from '../support/states.ts'; // What: Open State Function. Why: Each state has to be opened and settled before it's scanned. How: This loads it and waits for it.
import { STA_RCD_ARR } from '../support/states.ts'; // What: State Record Array. Why: Every page state is scanned. How: This lists them.
import { test        } from '@playwright/test';     // What: Test. Why: Each state is its own test. How: This declares them.

 * only with zero violations, and each failure names its rule, its impact,
 * and the elements it found. Anything axe can't decide on its own (its
 * "incomplete" results, such as text over an image) can't fail the run, so
 * it's printed and attached to the test as needing review by hand.

type AxeResTyp = Awaited< ReturnType< AxeBuilder[ 'analyze' ] > >; // What: Axe Results Type. Why: The scan's findings are summarized for the report, and axe-core itself is only a dependency of the Playwright integration. How: This reads the type from what AxeBuilder's analyze resolves to.

const AXE_TAG_ARR = [ 'wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21a', 'wcag21aa', 'wcag22aa', 'best-practice' ]; // What: Axe Tag Array. Why: The site targets WCAG 2.2 AA, which includes every earlier A and AA rule, and axe's best practices catch common problems WCAG doesn't name. How: This limits the scan to those rule sets.
